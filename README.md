## Disclaimer:

This project was developed as a personal practice exercise and is not intended to be a production-ready solution for real-world use. While it is a fully functional application that showcases my knowledge of React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit, it may contain limitations and may not have undergone extensive testing for various use cases.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills as a developer and to serve as a portfolio piece. Please use this application with this understanding and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

For production-level applications, appropriate testing, security measures, and optimizations should be applied before deployment to ensure a reliable and robust user experience.
